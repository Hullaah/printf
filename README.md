# Printf

**Recreating a versatile output function**

This repository houses my implementation of the _printf function in C, replicating the core functionality of the standard printf function from the standard input/output library.

## Objectives

- **Master C Programming**: Deepen Understanding of C syntax, control flow, variable manipulation, and function design
- **Conquer formatting**: Grasp the intricacies of formatted output, including conversion specifiers and string manipulation.
- **Embrace Complex data handling**:  Learn to manage diverse data types (characters, integers, strings) and their appropriate output representations.

## Key Features:

- **Formats and Prints**:  Produces formatted output to the console based on specified format specifiers.
- **Handles Various datatypes**:  Supports printing of characters, strings, integers, and other fundamental data types.
- **Flexible Output Customization**: Allows for precision control, field width adjustment, and other formatting options.

## Testing

To test the _printf function, you can either modify the file [tests/main.c](tests/main.c) or create a new file in the tests folder that you wan to use for testing then you have to compile and run this way:
```bash
gcc *.c tests/{testfile} -o printf
./printf
```
Replace {testfile} with the name of the test file.

Some things to check when testing the function:
- Experiment with different format specifiers and data types to verify functionality.
- Compare output with the original printf function for consistency.
- Utilize test cases to ensure accuracy across various scenarios.

## Contributions

- Feel free to suggest enhancements or reports via pull requests.
- Collaborate to expand functionality and refine implementation
